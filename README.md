"PasswordArmour" by pl4gu3 is a powerful password management project designed to generate a specified number of unique and strong passwords for different applications. The user is prompted to input the desired number of passwords, along with the corresponding app names and the desired length for each password.

Once the user provides the required information, PasswordArmour leverages the capabilities of the open-source library "openpyxl" to create a Microsoft Excel file (.xlsx). The generated Excel file acts as a secure database, storing the app names and their associated strong passwords in a structured manner.

To enhance the visual appearance and readability of the Excel file, PasswordArmour applies professional formatting techniques. It adds table-like borders to create a clean and organized layout. The table borders ensure clear separation between different cells, making it easier for users to locate specific information.

By using PasswordArmour, users can conveniently manage their passwords in a centralized and secure manner. The project eliminates the need to remember multiple complex passwords for various applications by providing a reliable solution for generating and storing strong passwords.
